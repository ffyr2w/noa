This directory defines the ``noa_tests`` executable.
To run the tests:

1. Clone the noa-data repository, run the setup script to generate the assets
   and set the environmental variable ``NOA_TEST_DATA`` to the repository path.
   See instructions at: https://github.com/ffyr2w/noa-data

2. Build the library and the executable.
   See instructions at: ../cmake/README.md

3. To run all tests, simply run `./noa_tests` in the command line.
   The command line arguments are parsed using Catch2.
   See instructions at: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v2.x/docs/command-line.md
