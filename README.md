### :construction: This repository is in its initial phase of development :construction:

## `Objectives`

This is a `C++20` static library, aiming to provide basic signal and image processing tools for
cryoEM software development. One goal is to retain reasonable efficiency so that it can be used in production code, 
while offering a relatively simple API.

## `WIP`

Errors were made during the initial development phase, so there are frequent major refactorings.
__This library should be considered an experiment__ and is a way for me to learn more about cryoEM software development.

## `Licence`

This will be moved to a more permissive licence in the future...
